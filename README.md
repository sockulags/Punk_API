# Punk API

## Features to add
Since this is to practise API requests, Im not sure I will fix these additional things. But, here is a list of additional exercises and things Id like to add. 
- Make site respoonsive
- Add advanced search
- Instead of arrows for next and previous card, make it behave like a deck of cards.

  
## Instructions

Your are building a beer-wiki that uses data from [Punk API:et](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). The web page will have three different views _(see further down for more information on each of the views)_. The views don't necessarily have to be seperate HTML documents. One HTML document that uses JavaScript to dynamically change the different views is totally cool as well. The most important requirement is that only ONE view can displayed at the time. Apart from the requirements that are listed further down, you have free reins.

### Requirements

#### Landing Page (Random beer) 

- The user should be presented with a random beer when visiting the this page. ✅

- The user should be able to get a random beer by clicking some sort of button. ✅

- The name and a image of the beer should be presented as a card _(se below for an example)_. ✅
